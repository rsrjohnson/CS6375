-python version 3.8

-All the code is on one file. You need the following libraries:

numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn
and matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf to generate the log file

-Please, read the comments and the report along with the logfile for better understanding.

-Data used: Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data Set. Hosted on: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsrjohnson/CS6375/master/SeoulBikeData.csv

-The tuning process was commented on the code for convenience (#tuning_process()). Uncomment it to generate the logfile. This process can take about 5 minutes.

-The preprocess of the data is handled automatically by a function and it splits the data into 80/20 training/testing proportion.

-The neural network has the following parameters: activation_func (sigmoid, tanh, relu), hidden_layers (a list of the sizes of each hidden layer ex: [6, 4]), alg (vanilla or AMSGrad ) , learning_rate, epochs, tol

-You can pass the parameters for the neural network via console. You will be prompt to enter every parameter at a time. Parameters values are suggested. If any unsupported value is entered, the value of that parameter will be set to a default.
